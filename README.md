# simplejQueryAccordion
Simple jQuery accordion for menu's and content.


I used this for sidebar menu's and displaying content when need for accordion, like (FAQ's or Issue's). It's very simpel a few lines of code. The css can be changed to fit any theme or template..

The only thing that is required is the content wrapper
<code>
  .accordion-panel {
    display:none;. 
  }  
</code>
This can be done in the css or using jquery.
